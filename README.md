# Ansible Role: Security

**Remember, securing YOUR PC/server is YOUR OWN responsibility.** This is a very basic template and it should be used as a _template_, not a complete solution.

This role performs some basic security configuration on RedHat and Debian based Linux systems, like:

- Install and configure [fail2ban](https://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) to monitor bad SSH logins.
- Basic SSH hardening like
  - Disable root login.
  - Disable password authentication.
  - Enable key-based authentication.
  - Change the default port.
  - Disable known weak algorithms.
- Set up automatic updates.
- Basic kernel-hardening.

## Requirements

None.

## Role Variables

## Dependencies

None.

## Example Playbook

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: username.rolename, x: 42 }
